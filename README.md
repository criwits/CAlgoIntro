# CAlgoIntro
Try to implement some algorithms in the book *Introduction to Algorithms* in C (and maybe C++).

> Note that not every algorithm & problem in that book will be implemented here, and not every problem here is from that
book.
## Now finished
- Dynamic Programming
  - Longest Common Subsequence
- Divide-and-Conquer
  - Median of Two Arrays

## Code structure
For each problem there'll be an independent directory to hold it's code. For example, the directory
`longest_common_subsequence` saves the code of the problem 'Longest Common Subsequence'. 

Inside each directory there
may be a folder named `lib` which stores some simple and stupid small C basic data structures libraries such as `queue` 
and `stack`.

My code style is more or less like K&R. However, sometimes I prefer `thisExample` to `this_example`.

## IDE I'm using
I'm using CLion by JetBrains to write these code. It's a wonderful IDE.
